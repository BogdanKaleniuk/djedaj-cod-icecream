After a meal of snow, ice and small pieces of orange, lemon and pomegranate seeds, they were served as a dessert after a rich meal.
                Hundreds of years have passed, and the Chinese have perfected the recipe. For whom ice and snow stench was mixed with milk. And so they learned how to cook a dessert that was even more folded with frosts - it’s already signifi- cantly close to the current frost. Before the new one, there were already three types of milk: buffalo, cow's and goat's.
                They were mixed with rice and played along. Sour sumish was salted, added borosno for thickening and camphor for aroma.

            <p class="popup-text">There are several ways to prepare cold coffee. In the first case, the finished hot drink is cooled to the desired temperature, in the second case, coffee is prepared by keeping ground beans in water (for example, using a French press), after which it is filtered [1].
                Often ice coffee is prepared like a hot analogue of a coffee drink. So, there are “cold latte”, “cold mocha”. These drinks are made by mixing hot espresso with the required amount of chilled milk.

            <p class="popup-text">1880s-1930s When the term "milkshake" was first used in print in 1885, milkshakes were whiskey-based alcoholic beverages. Milkshake has been described as "a strong, wholesome eggnog-type drink with milk, whiskey, raw eggs, etc., serving as a tonic as well as a treat"[1]. However, 15 years later, by 1900, the term milkshake referred to “healthy drinks made with chocolate, strawberry or vanilla syrup.” Around the same time, ice cream was added to the milkshake. By the 1930s, non-alcoholic milkshakes were already popular drinks in the US and were sold in [specialty coffee shops selling soda on tap.
