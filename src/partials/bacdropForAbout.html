      <p class="modal__text">
        <p class="modal__text__item">Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.</p>
        <p class="modal__text__item">It may be made
        from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a
        spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.</p>
        <p class="modal__text__item">It can also
        be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.</p>
        <p class="modal__text__item">Food coloring is
        sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers.</p>
        <p class="modal__text__item">The mixture is cooled below the freezing point
        of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from
        forming.</p>
        <p class="modal__text__item"> The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures
        (below 2 °C or 35 °F).</p>
        <p class="modal__text__item">It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>
                <p class="modal__text__item">The meaning of the name "ice cream" varies from one country to another.</p><br>
